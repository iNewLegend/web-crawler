                changes to the Sitemaps protocol and/or the Specification, including, without limitation,
                to make changes that result in your existing sitemaps files becoming non-compliant
                with the revised protocol.&nbsp; The Sponsors shall have no liability to you for
                any such changes. Each of the Sponsors reserves the right to use, or not use, the

            <h2>
                Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                We make no effort to personally identify users of the Website. No identifying data
                is collected from the Website or disclosed to any third party for any purpose. Non-identifying
                data that we collect in connection with the Website is used only for server administration
                and the general operation of the Website. The foregoing does not apply to email
                sent to contact email addresses listed on the Website, which may contain personally
                identifiable information, and which we will use solely as necessary to respond to
                the applicable email.
            </p>
            <p>
                We log http requests to the Website. As a result, we are aware of the originating
                IP address of a machine requesting a Website URL. We do not log the specific identity
                of visitors. We may analyze our log files to determine how the Website is being
                used. Logged information is kept indefinitely as administrative and research material,
                but it is not disclosed other than to the Sponsors’ personnel. Aggregate, non-identifiable
                statistics generated from our logs may be used for research purposes.

            <h2>
                Miscellaneous Provisions</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
                laws of the State of California, without giving effect to their conflict of laws
                provisions or those of your actual state or country of residence. If for any reason
                a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of the Terms of
                Service to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms of Service will continue
                in full force and effect.
            </p>
            <p>
                These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Sponsors
                with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior
                or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such
                subject matter. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms of Service will be effective
                only if in writing and signed by all of the Sponsors.
            </p>
